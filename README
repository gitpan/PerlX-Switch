NAME
    PerlX::Switch - yet another switch statement for Perl

SYNOPSIS
       my $day_type;
   
       switch ($day) {
          case 0, 6:  $day_type = "weekend";
          default:    $day_type = "weekday";
       }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides Perl with a switch statement. It's more reliable than
    the Switch module (which is broken on recent versions of Perl anyway),
    less confusing than `use feature 'switch'`, and more powerful than
    Switch::Plain (though Switch::Plain is significantly faster).

    PerlX::Switch uses the Perl keyword API, which was introduced in Perl
    5.14, so this module does not work on older releases of Perl.

    The basic grammar of the switch statement is as follows:

       switch ( TEST ) {
          case EXPR1: STATEMENT1;
          case EXPR2: STATEMENT2;
          default:    STATEMENT3;
       }

    TEST is evaluated in scalar context. Each expression EXPR1, EXPR2, etc is
    evaluated in list context. If TEST matches any of the expression, then the
    statement following it is executed. Matching is performed by
    match::simple, which is a simplified version of the Perl smart match
    operator. If no match is successful, then the `default` statement is
    executed.

    `switch` is whole statement, so does not need to be followed by a
    semicolon.

    Within the switch block, $_ is a read-only alias to the TEST value.

    That's the basics taken care of, but there are several variations...

  Implicit test
    If the test is omitted, then $_ is tested:

       my $day_type;
   
       $_ = $day;
       switch {
          case 0, 6:  $day_type = "weekend";
          default:    $day_type = "weekday";
       }

  Expression blocks
    If `case` is followed by a `{` character, this is *not* interpreted as the
    start of an anonymous hashref, but as a block. Matching via match::simple
    is not attempted; instead the block is evaluated as a boolean.

       switch ($number) {
          case 0:           say "zero";
          case { $_ % 2 }:  say "an odd number";
          default:          say "an even number";
       }

  Statement blocks
    If the first non-whitespace character is `{`, the statement is treated as
    a block rather than a single statement:

       switch ($number) {
          case 0: {
             say "zero";
          }
          case { $_ % 2 }: {
             say "an odd number";
          }
          default: {
             say "an even number";
          }
       }

  Comparison expression
    Above I said that matching is performed by match::simple. That was a lie.
    match::simple is just the default. You can provide your own expression for
    matching:

       switch ($number) if ($a > $b) {
          case 1000:   say "greater than 1000";
          case 100:    say "greater than 100";
          case 10:     say "greater than 10";
          case 1:      say "greater than 1";
       }

    $a is the TERM and $b is the EXPR.

  Switch expressions
    Although `switch` acts as a full statement usually, it can be used as part
    of an expression if the keyword `do` appears before the block:

       my $day_type = switch ($day) do {
          case 0, 6:  "weekend";
          default:    "weekday";
       };

  Fallthrough
    There's no fallthrough.

  `match($x, $y)`
    This module can also re-export the `match` function from match::simple,
    but not by default.

       use PerlX::Switch qw( match switch );

CAVEATS
    Internally a lot of parts of code are passed around as coderefs, so
    certain things might not work how you'd expect inside `switch`:

    *   `caller`

    *   `return`

    *   @_
